# Frontend Test

## Challenges and decisions
  1. The decision of which Third party GraphQL API service to use was a little hard one 
  2. Ran to some infinite loop which is due to missing dependency while fetching data from the API
  3. Decided to design the GraphQL API schema for something like a order application service
  4. Didn't bother to use any state management like Redux or React Contex API since it's a simple web app

## Shortcuts
  1. No state management is used - Used prop drilling
  2. Wrote some little media queries for responsiveness but not for all screens
